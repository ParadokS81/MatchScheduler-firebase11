# AI Collaboration Guide for MatchScheduler

## üéØ Purpose
This guide helps both the human project lead and AI assistants work together effectively on the MatchScheduler project. It defines workflows, context management, and best practices for productive AI-assisted development.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start for New Sessions

### Human Project Lead:
1. **Start your dev environment**: `./dev.sh`
2. **Check PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** for current status
3. **Prepare your context** for the AI:
   ```
   Hi! I'm working on MatchScheduler, a gaming community scheduling platform.
   - Current Phase: [X] 
   - Working on: [specific task]
   - Context docs: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, [relevant PRD section]
   ```

### AI Assistant:
1. **Read provided context** thoroughly
2. **Acknowledge current phase** and task
3. **Use qnew** to load project best practices
4. **Follow established patterns** from existing code

---

## üìÅ Context Management Strategy

### Essential Context Hierarchy:
1. **Always Include:**
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific guidelines and shortcuts
   - `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Current status and next tasks

2. **Phase-Specific Context:**
   - **Phase 1**: `/context/1_Vision/project_prd_v2.md` (First-Time User section)
   - **Phase 2**: `/context/1_Vision/project_prd_v2.md` (Core Features section)
   - **Phase 3**: `/context/1_Vision/project_prd_v2.md` (Advanced Features section)

3. **Technical Context (as needed):**
   - `/context/2_Architecture/technical_decisions_v3.md` - Firebase patterns
   - `/context/2_Architecture/project_frontend.md` - UI patterns
   - `/context/2_Architecture/project_performance_ux.md` - Performance requirements

### Token Budget Management:
- **Start small**: Only include immediately relevant sections
- **Expand as needed**: Add technical docs when hitting implementation details
- **Summarize progress**: Don't re-read completed features
- **Use shortcuts**: `qnew`, `qplan`, `qcode` instead of re-explaining

## üîÑ Session Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Implementation Session
```
Human: "I want to implement [feature] from Phase X"
AI: *Reads context* ‚Üí *Uses qplan* ‚Üí *Proposes approach*
Human: "Looks good, proceed"
AI: *Uses qcode* ‚Üí *Implements* ‚Üí *Uses qcheck*
Human: *Tests* ‚Üí "Works! Let's commit"
AI: *Uses qgit* ‚Üí *Updates PROJECT_ROADMAP.md*
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Fix Session
```
Human: "The [feature] isn't working, here's the error: [error]"
AI: *Analyzes* ‚Üí *Proposes fix* ‚Üí *Implements*
Human: *Tests* ‚Üí "Fixed!"
AI: *Commits with fix(*) prefix*
```

### Pattern 3: Architecture Discussion
```
Human: "How should we approach [complex feature]?"
AI: *References PRD and architecture docs* ‚Üí *Proposes options*
Human: "Let's go with option B"
AI: *Documents decision in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md*
```

## üß≠ Navigation Shortcuts

### For Human Project Lead:

#### Starting Work:
- **Check status**: "What's our current progress on Phase X?"
- **Get oriented**: "Show me what we built in the last session"
- **Plan ahead**: "What are the dependencies for the next feature?"

#### During Work:
- **Quality check**: "qcheck this implementation"
- **Performance**: "Will this meet our hot path requirements?"
- **Gaming context**: "qgaming - does this work for team leaders?"

#### Ending Work:
- **Save progress**: "qgit"
- **Update status**: "Update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with our progress"
- **Plan next**: "What should I work on next session?"

### For AI Assistant:

#### Context Awareness:
- Always check current phase in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
- Respect the sacred 3x3 grid layout constraints
- Follow Firebase v11 patterns established in Phase 0
- Use revealing module pattern for new components

#### Code Generation:
- Match existing code style (no comments unless asked)
- Use rem units for all sizing
- Follow hot path performance requirements
- Test with gaming community scale (40 teams, 300 players)

## üéÆ Gaming Community Context Reminders

### Always Consider:
1. **Discord-centric** communication patterns
2. **Tournament deadlines** create urgency
3. **Team leaders** are volunteer coordinators
4. **Availability windows** are for gaming sessions (evenings/weekends)
5. **Quick actions** needed during tournament pressure

### User Personas to Keep in Mind:
- **Busy Team Leader**: Needs efficient tools, quick actions
- **New Player**: Needs clear onboarding, no friction
- **Tournament Organizer**: Needs to see multiple team availabilities
- **Returning User**: Needs persistent data, quick access

## üö´ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Overbuilding
**Symptom**: "Let me also add these 5 related features..."
**Solution**: Stick to current slice checklist only

### Pitfall 2: Forgetting State
**Symptom**: "Wait, did we already build authentication?"
**Solution**: Always check PROJECT_ROADMAP.md first

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Patterns
**Symptom**: Using class components or v8 Firebase syntax
**Solution**: Reference Phase 0 implementation patterns

### Pitfall 4: Lost Context
**Symptom**: AI doesn't understand project specifics
**Solution**: Start with "qnew" shortcut

### Pitfall 5: Scope Creep
**Symptom**: "This would be cool to add..."
**Solution**: Document in "Future Ideas" but stay on track

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Daily Progress Template:
```markdown
## Session Date: YYYY-MM-DD

### Started:
- Phase X.Y at Z% complete
- Task: [specific task]

### Completed:
- [x] Implemented [feature]
- [x] Fixed [bug]
- [x] Updated [documentation]

### Blockers:
- [Issue description and impact]

### Next Session:
- Continue with [next task]
- Address [blocker]

### Time Spent: X hours
```

### Weekly Review Questions:
1. What features were completed?
2. What patterns emerged?
3. What was harder than expected?
4. What was easier than expected?
5. Are we on track for phase completion?

## üí° Effective Prompting Tips

### Good Prompts:
‚úÖ "Implement the Google OAuth integration from Phase 1.1"
‚úÖ "The availability grid is rendering slowly, how can we optimize?"
‚úÖ "qcheck the TeamService module I just wrote"

### Less Effective Prompts:
‚ùå "Build the whole authentication system"
‚ùå "Make it faster"
‚ùå "Add some features"

### Context-Rich Prompts:
```
I'm working on Phase 1.1 (Authentication) of MatchScheduler.
Current status: Google Sign-In UI is complete
Next task: Handle auth state changes and create profile
Specific question: How should we handle the first-time user profile creation flow?
```
