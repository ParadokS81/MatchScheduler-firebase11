## üõ†Ô∏è AI Collaboration Workflow

### Starting a New Session

1. **Open CLAUDE.md** - Review shortcuts and guidelines
2. **Open PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** - Check current phase and next tasks
3. **Start with context**: 
   ```
   I'm working on MatchScheduler Phase X, Slice Y.
   Current status: [describe what's complete]
   Next task: [specific task from checklist]
   ```

### During Implementation

1. **Use shortcuts**:
   - `qnew` - Load best practices
   - `qplan` - Plan implementation approach
   - `qcode` - Execute implementation
   - `qcheck` - Validate code quality

2. **Test incrementally** - After each checklist item
3. **Update this document** - Mark tasks complete
4. **Commit meaningful chunks** - Use `qgit` for commits

### Ending a Session

1. **Update status** in this document
2. **Document blockers** or decisions needed
3. **Note the next task** for easy resumption
4. **Commit all changes**

---

## üìä Git Strategy

### Branch Structure
- `main` - Stable, tested features only
- `dev` - Active development
- `feature/phase-X-slice-Y` - Specific implementation branches

### Commit Convention
```
feat(phase-1): implement Google OAuth integration
fix(availability): correct timezone handling
docs(roadmap): update Phase 1 progress
```

### Milestone Tags
- `v0.1.0` - Phase 1 Complete (Basic Onboarding)
- `v0.2.0` - Phase 2 Complete (Core Scheduling)
- `v1.0.0` - Phase 3 Complete (Full Feature Set)

---

## üéì Learning Checkpoints

### After Each Slice:
1. **Code Review** - Use Cursor to review implementation
2. **Pattern Recognition** - What patterns worked well?
3. **Performance Check** - Does it meet PRD requirements?
4. **User Test** - Can you complete the user journey?
5. **Document Learnings** - Add notes below

### Learning Notes:
<!-- Add your discoveries and insights here -->

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't skip test criteria** - Each slice must work end-to-end
2. **Don't over-engineer** - Build only what's in the current slice
3. **Don't forget real-time** - Test with multiple browser tabs
4. **Don't ignore performance** - Check against PRD requirements
5. **Don't skip commits** - Commit after each working feature

## üìù Decision Log

### Major Decisions:
1. **Hybrid Emulator Strategy** (2024-01-10)
   - Reason: Better reflects production performance
   - Impact: Faster development, real security rules testing

2. **Vertical Slice Approach** (2024-01-10)
   - Reason: Delivers working features incrementally
   - Impact: Better progress visibility, easier testing

<!-- Add more decisions as they're made -->

Last Updated: 2025-01-16
Next Review: After Phase 1.2 completion

## üìù Session Notes (2025-01-16)

### Phase 1.1 Completion Summary:
- **Authentication Flow:** Complete end-to-end Google OAuth with profile creation
- **Database Integration:** Users and event logging properly implemented
- **UI Polish:** Clean guest/authenticated states with proper database profile loading
- **Functions Emulator:** Properly connected to local development environment
- **Error Handling:** Toast notifications and proper validation in place
- **Edit Profile Modal:** Dual-mode modal for profile creation and editing
- **Discord Integration:** Simple manual linking (username + user ID) without OAuth complexity

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **Firebase v11 Modular Imports:** All components use proper async imports
- **Direct Database Profile Loading:** Auth state triggers profile fetch from Firestore
- **Dual DisplayName Pattern:** Google Auth name vs database profile name distinction
- **Revealing Module Pattern:** All components follow consistent architectural pattern
- **Simple Discord Approach:** Manual entry over OAuth for reduced complexity

### Discord Integration Enhancement:
- **PRD Compliance:** Implements PRD 4.4.1 Discord linking requirements
- **Simple Approach:** User manually enters Discord username and ID
- **Future-Ready:** Foundation for team leader contact features
- **Data Storage:** `users.discordUsername` and `users.discordUserId` fields
- **Validation:** Both fields required together, proper format validation

### Next Session Focus:
- **Phase 1.2 - Team Creation:** Implement team creation flow per PRD requirements
- **Team Management:** Basic team info display and join code generation
- **Onboarding Modal:** Unified create/join team interface
