# MatchScheduler Implementation Roadmap v3

## Overview
Vertical slice implementation strategy. Each slice delivers complete working functionality.
Detailed specifications in `/context/slices/[slice-name].md`

## Sequencing Rationale
- **Part 1:** Can't do anything without authenticated users and teams
- **Part 2:** Core value prop - individual then team availability  
- **Part 3:** Network effect features require Part 2 data
- **Part 4:** Polish after core features proven

## Performance Requirements
- **Part 1:** Authentication < 2s (cold path)
- **Part 2:** Availability updates < 50ms (hot path)
- **Part 3:** Comparison < 50ms setup, < 2s results
- **Part 4:** Maintain all performance

- "Compare H2H" button navigates to Head to Head tab
- Upcoming games placeholder section

**Note:** Seed scripts updated with correct QWHub clan tags for all 24 teams. Record format uses compact W-L dash format (green-red coloring). Teams without QWHub tags show "Match history not available".

## Part 6: UI Polish & Refactoring

### 📅 Slice 6.0: Team Panel UI Refactor
**Status:** Not Started
**User Value:** Cleaner team management UX via modal, grid tools closer to roster
**Spec:** `context/slices/slice-6.0-team-panel-refactor.md`
**Components:** TeamManagementModal (new), TeamInfo (modify), GridActionButtons (relocate)
**Scope:**
- Move team management from drawer to modal (click team name/gear icon)
- Relocate Grid Tools to collapsible drawer in team panel (below roster)
- Remove old TeamManagementDrawer component
- Better resolution handling at 1080p/1440p

**Sub-slices:**
- 6.0a: Team Management Modal
- 6.0b: Grid Tools Drawer (in team panel)
- 6.0c: Cleanup old drawer

**Note:** Drawer struggled with variable content height. Modal handles complex content better. Grid Tools drawer has bounded content (max 4-5 rows) - ideal for drawer pattern.

---

## Progress Summary
**Slices Complete:** 28 / ~36 (Part 5 expanded with 5.2 cluster)

## Current Focus
**Slice 5.2 - Team Detail Redesign** - Tabbed team detail view with rich landing page, split-panel match history, stats popout, and head-to-head comparison.

## QW Hub Integration Path
5.1 → 5.1a → 5.1b (basic) → **5.2a → 5.2b → 5.2c → 5.2d** (full redesign)

Each 5.2 slice builds on the previous:
- 5.2a: Tab infrastructure + Details landing page (foundation)
- 5.2b: Match History split-panel (requires 5.2a tabs)
- 5.2c: Stats popout modal (requires 5.2b "Full Stats" button)
- 5.2d: H2H tab (requires 5.2a tabs, reuses 5.2b/c patterns)
