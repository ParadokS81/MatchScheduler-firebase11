# Architecture Test Plan

## Refactored Architecture Summary

We've successfully refactored the codebase to follow the original architecture from the PRD:

### What Changed:

1. **TeamInfo.js** - Now uses direct Firebase listeners
   - Removed dependency on TeamService callbacks
   - Each component manages its own `onSnapshot` listener
   - Updates TeamService cache when receiving real-time updates

2. **TeamService.js** - Focused on its proper role
   - Removed `subscribeToTeam` and `unsubscribeFromTeam` methods
   - Maintains cache for fast browsing (PRD 5.3)
   - Handles one-time operations: create, join, get teams
   - Added `updateCachedTeam` for components to update cache

3. **Architecture Benefits**:
   - Components have direct connection to Firebase (no middleware)
   - Simpler debugging - if data is wrong, check the component's listener
   - Cache provides instant browsing while listeners keep active data fresh
   - Follows the "Direct Data Flow" principle from Pillar 3

## Testing Steps:

1. **Test Team Creation**:
   - Sign in with Google
   - Create a new team
   - Verify team appears immediately in TeamInfo panel
   - Check console for "Direct Firebase listener attached" message

2. **Test Real-time Updates**:
   - Open app in two browser tabs
   - Sign in as different users
   - Join same team in both tabs
   - Create team in one tab, join in other
   - Verify roster updates in real-time in both tabs

3. **Test Team Switching** (Hot Path):
   - Create/join 2 teams
   - Switch between teams
   - Should be instant (using cached data)
   - Verify listener switches to new team

4. **Test Cache + Listener Coordination**:
   - Browse teams (uses cache)
   - Select a team (sets up listener)
   - Make changes in another tab
   - Verify selected team updates via listener
   - Verify cache updates for browsing

## Console Messages to Verify:

‚úÖ Should see:
- `üì° Direct Firebase listener attached for team: [team name]`
- `üîÑ Team data updated via direct listener: [team name]`
- `üì¶ Team loaded from cache: [team id]` (when switching teams)
- `üîÑ Cache updated for team: [team name]`

‚ùå Should NOT see:
- Any mentions of "subscribeToTeam"
- Callback-related messages
- Complex state management errors

## Architecture Validation:

The refactored code now matches the PRD vision:
- Pre-loaded cache for instant browsing (cold path)
- Direct listeners for active data (hot path)
- No complex middleware or callback chains
- Components own their data subscriptions
